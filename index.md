I am a roboticist at heart, and a professional in the domain of robotics. I seek to understand robots better. I am strongly optimistic that intelligent systems can help humanity solve a myriad of challenges in diverse domains. My career interests lie at intersection of robot algorithms and software development. My skillset includes sensor fusion, state estimation, controls, deep learning, and mechtronics.

I am currently developing perception algorithms for L2 self-driving systems for adventurous electric vehicles at Rivian Automotive LLC. Prior to this, I worked as a perception engineer at NIO USA Inc., developing state-of-the-art sensor fusion algorithms for the L4 autonomous driving stack for their electric passenger vehicles. I strive to write readable, efficient, and optimized software. My prefered programming language is C++, I also use Python, MATLAB, and HTML/CSS in my projects.

In my an alternate life, I am a musician. My other interests include: music, going on hikes, sitting by the water bodies, football (soccer), and experiencing different places and cultures. My long term goal is to start-up my own personal robotics company building self-sufficient robots that can integrate seamlessly into our society, contributing joy in the lives of people.
