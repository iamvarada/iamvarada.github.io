I am a roboticist at heart, and a professional in the domain of robotics. I am strongly optimistic that intelligent systems can help humanity solve a myriad of challenges in diverse domains. If I were living an alternate life, I would have been a musician. My other than work interests include: music, hikes, football (soccer), cricket, and experiencing different places and cultures. My long term goal is to start-up my own personal robotics company building robots and systems which can contribute joy in the lives of people.

My career interests lie at intersection of robot algorithms and software development. My skillset includes sensor fusion, state estimation, controls, deep learning, and mechtronics. I developed an intense fascination for this field because of the underlying mathematical principles. My initial interest in man-machine systems was first triggered by Michael Bay’s 2007 Hollywood movie, Transformers. This inclination towards robotics was further fueled by my project with the Locomotion and Biomechanics Control (LBC) Lab, and Intelligent Vehicles and Systems Group (IVSG) at Penn State during my first semester as a graduate student. I pursued graduate research in the IVSG group at Penn State, advised by Dr. Sean N. Brennan. I am currently working as a perception engineer at NIO USA Inc., developing sensor fusion algorithms for the L4 autonomous driving stack for electric passenger vehicles.

I enjoy music, and I train in Carnatic vocals, an Indian classical music art form. I enjoy working on electronic music, and that has led me to teach myself digital piano, and ukelele. I like to take out time for music, and I perform as a vocalist whenever I get a chance. I try to stay physically fit; training for marathon is my preferred way of staying fit.
