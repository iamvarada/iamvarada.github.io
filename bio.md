# Brief Bio

I received a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from [VIT University](https://vit.ac.in/), Vellore in India in 2014, and a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in 2019. I specialized in robotics, control systems, and state estimation during my Masters, and my thesis broadly focused on free space estimation in front of a RADAR and camera equipped connected truck. My Masters work was funded by [Advanced Research and Project Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/) divison of [Department of Engergy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/). The work was presented and published in ASME Dyanamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC) 2018 [link](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-abstract/DSCC2019/59148/V001T01A006/1070510).

Before coming to the U.S.A to puruse graudate studies, I worked as a junior research fellow for two years at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) in Bengaluru, India. During my time in IISc, I worked on two projects : a smart asistive device, and setting up India's first smart-manufacturing lab. During my time working on the two projects, I partnered and worked with [Ministry of Science](http://techport.gov.in/) (India), [Fortis Hospitals](https://fortisbangalore.com/campaign/best-multispeciality-hospital-in-bangalore/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwka_1BRCPARIsAMlUmEpqfEa965UuabLwMFOzkKfiDBaAu1hwdnfkZdFaXWA0s_-WLELHV8QaArocEALw_wcB) (Bengaluru), and [Boeing Research and Technology](http://www.boeing.com/) (USA). The work resulted in 1 patent, apart from setting up the smart manufacturing lab.

During my B.Tech., I worked with the [Camera Culture Group](http://cameraculture.media.mit.edu/) at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) on devweloping diagnostic devices for eye. I was selected to present one of the work with the group to Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India. Additionally, I worked with the [Consortium of Affordable Medical Technologies (CAMTech)](http://camtech.mgh.harvard.edu/) at the [Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)](https://www.massgeneral.org/) to develop affordable medical technologies for developing and under-developed economies. During this time, I participated and won multiple medical hackathons in Uganda, India, and USA. Finally, I enjoyed a 1-year stint building Formula Student race cars and represented my undergraudate university at the [Formula SAE Italy](https://www.formula-ata.it/) in 2012.

I currently working in the Bay Area on developing perception algorithms, and writing the corresponding software for the self-driving system of [Rivian Automotive LLC](https://rivian.com/). I have been working on self-driving algorithns for nearly 2 years now.

> Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; <br /> 
> Where knowledge is free; <br /> 
> Where the world has not been broken up into fragments <br /> 
> By narrow domestic walls; <br /> 
> Where words come out from the depth of truth; <br /> 
> Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; <br /> 
> <br /> 
> Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way; <br /> 
> Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; <br /> 
> Where the mind is led forward by thee; <br /> 
> Into ever-widening thought and action; <br /> 
> Into that heaven of freedom, <br />
