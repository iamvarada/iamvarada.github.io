      <h3>Autonomous Control of a RC Car (<a href="https://github.com/iamvarada/Autonomous-Control-of-a-RC-Car/blob/master/Autonomous_RC_car_LineFollowingRoutine.ino">Code</a>) </h3>

      <p> Remote controlled vehicles have the potential to go faster than it can usually be controlled. By converting this remote-controlled car to an autonomous car, powered by an Ardunio, this limitation on the performance can be removed. The goal of the project was introducing an Arduino-controlled RC type vehicle as a lab in the course curriculum of the senior-level Mechatronics course at Penn State, a demonstration on how an Arduino controlled RC car operates, and an example competition for the students. </p>

      <h3>Autonomous Object Picking Arm (<a href="https://github.com/iamvarada/Autonomous-Object-Picking-Machine/blob/master/autonomous_object_picking_machine_final_code.ino">Code</a>) </h3>
      <img src="/assets/img/two_link_arm.jpg" alt="linkArm" style="width:50%">
      <p>Autonomous object detection and grasping has a wide range of application across various domains. The goal of this project was to design and develop an autonomous oject picking machine. The arm was mounted on a rotating disk with a range of 360 degree. The object detection module was built using a Pixy camera, and the actuation and control module was deployed on an Arduino. The device was capable of detecting a red object anywehre in its 360 degree range, pick it up and place it at a pre-assigned location. Inverse kinematics of a two-link arm was used to determine the initial position of the object. </p>
